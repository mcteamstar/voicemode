      writing chunks and tear the stream down (abort, don't drain). Two reasons

      transport request hands off to the skip-back replay loop. The request is
      left pending here (peek only) so converse consumes it with
      ``take_transport_request``.
    * On **pause**, holds here until the channel is resumed, stopped, or a

      ``True`` if the pause ended in a stop or a transport press (so "pause, then
